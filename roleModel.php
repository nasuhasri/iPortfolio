Someone that we wants to follow every step single that they took and my role model is <strong><u><a href="https://twitter.com/itsteme" target="no_blank">Teme Abdullah.</a></u></strong></p>

                            <p class="description" style="font-size: medium;">He is a writer of 8 books. All his books has its own great value where we can apply them in our life. When he wants to produce a new book, he will take a considerate of his readers who are mostly students. He will ask a lot of questions to know either his readers afford to buy his books. In the early involvement in being a writer, he sneaked out to a book store then write notes for his readers and put them in his books. This kind of small gesture really takes a big effort to do it as he do not want people to know him.</p>

                            <p class="description">He was graduated from architect school in United Kingdom and now works as an architect there since 2016. He has a great career and very passionate in drawing. I like how he portays his life in his books where I get to see how difficult it is to live overseas and gain money while study. I still remember how difficult he was to choose between religion course and architect course. Therefore, I want to be like him, someone who has both dunya and akhirah. I want to be a software engineer that can contribute more to my society and religion.</p>

                            <p class="description">He has achieve many great achievements in his life. One of the biggest achievement was when he presented his books and tplanner to the King and Queen. However, he is still the same person that always love his readers and thought them as his own friends. He celebrated all his works and achievements with his readers and I can feel how sincere he is.</p>

                            <p class="description">Looking at how he wrote his books, how he manage to find words to make people understand his point of views, how he get to express his views in many things, then we would see how intelligent he is. Not just looking at his academic profile but on how he views the reality and environment of him and others.</p>

                            <p class="description">One word that can describe Teme Abdullah is creative. He is very creative. Other than being creative at his own works, he also creative in creating a character in his books and making a great content out of it. I believe he is a great architect that can produce a great work. Hence I aspired to be like him in my own field which is computer science.</p>
